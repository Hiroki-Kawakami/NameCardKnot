# NameCardKnot — Notes for Claude

Firmware for an M5PaperS3-class name-card device: an **ESP32-S3 + 960×540
grayscale EPD** (`paper_s3` board). Built on the reusable **`esp-devkit`** BSP /
simulator infrastructure, with a host SDL simulator so UI/app logic can be
developed and verified without hardware. Early stage — the BSP display +
simulator + sim harness are in place, and the **device EPD + touch paths are
implemented** (ED047TC1 panel over the ESP32-S3 i80 bus — a transaction-index
waveform engine driving up to 15 concurrent refresh generations on an async
background task, with a `BSP_EPD_MODE_FULL` flag for ghost-clear full flushes;
GT911 touch over I2C via the in-tree `gt911` polling driver). **LVGL is
wired up** via the `ui_framework` LVGL port abstraction + an app-side BSP↔LVGL
binding; the app itself is still minimal (one home screen).

> **Keep the docs current.** When you change the build flow, the BSP surface
> (`bsp_*`), the simulator backend, add a board/target, or hit a non-obvious
> gotcha, update CLAUDE.md (and the right `docs/` file) in the same change — they
> are the handoff to the next session. Keep CLAUDE.md lean: deep verification
> detail lives in [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md) and gotchas in
> [`docs/gotchas.md`](docs/gotchas.md) — link, don't inline.

> **Comment only what earns it.** Write a code comment when its absence would
> cause a concrete mistake later — not to narrate the obvious or to hedge. In
> particular: don't explain one mechanism by describing its alternatives (e.g. the
> locking story inside an `lv_async_call` comment), and in a per-target file don't
> describe the other target at length (the device `CMakeLists.txt` needn't explain
> the host build). When in doubt, leave it out.

## Build environment

The ESP-IDF (v5.4.3) toolchain and the host-simulator tools (cmake, ninja, gcc,
SDL2, libjpeg, cjson) all come from the Nix flake. **Always run build commands
through `nix develop -c <cmd>`** (or from inside a `nix develop` shell) — never
invoke `idf.py` / `cmake` directly. `.envrc` is `use flake`, so direnv users get
the shell automatically. (See [`docs/gotchas.md`](docs/gotchas.md) for the
git-tracked-files and submodule caveats.)

**`esp-devkit/` is a git submodule** (`github.com/Hiroki-Kawakami/esp-devkit`)
holding the `bsp`, `idf_compat`, and `sim_harness` components. Edits there are
commits to *that* repo, not NameCardKnot. `app/`, `simulator/`, and `esp32s3/` are
this repo.

## Targets & commands

```sh
./run.sh                                          # build + run the interactive SDL simulator
./run.sh simverify simulator/verify/smoke.txt     # headless scripted verification → docs/testing.md
./run.sh esp32s3                                  # idf.py -C esp32s3 flash monitor (needs a TTY)
```

(Call as `nix develop -c ./run.sh ...` or from a dev shell.)

    sim/lv_conf.h     #     default LVGL config for the simulator build (overridable)
```

Rule of thumb: shared/reusable → `esp-devkit/` (the submodule); app-specific →
`app/`; target-only entry → that target's build root.

### Component wiring

Components are self-describing via `idf_component_register()`. On **device**,
ESP-IDF consumes it directly. On the **simulator**, `simulator/CMakeLists.txt`
defines a shim that folds each component's `SRCS`/`INCLUDE_DIRS` straight into the
one `simulator` executable (so includes are effectively global; `REQUIRES` are
ignored). A component that differs per target branches on `ESP_PLATFORM` (set only
under ESP-IDF) inside its own `CMakeLists.txt` — see `bsp/CMakeLists.txt`. New
simulator component → add it to `SIMULATOR_COMPONENTS` in `simulator/CMakeLists.txt`.
(`ui_framework` is the worked example of a component that *also* pulls a host
library: its simulator branch `FetchContent`s LVGL and links it onto the
`simulator` target directly — the shim only folds sources, not external targets.)

On **device**, `esp32s3/CMakeLists.txt` lists `../esp-devkit/bsp` and
`../esp-devkit/ui_framework` in `EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS` (`idf_compat`/`sim_harness`
are host-only), and any component that `#include`s `bsp.h` must name `bsp` in its
`REQUIRES` (e.g. `app/CMakeLists.txt`, which also names `ui_framework`). The device EPD path adds `esp_lcd` to the bsp `PRIV_REQUIRES`
and the `ed047tc1`/`driver` dirs to its `PRIV_INCLUDE_DIRS`; the touch path is the
in-tree `gt911` driver (no managed dependency) — it adds the `gt911` dir to
`PRIV_INCLUDE_DIRS` and relies on `driver` (already in `PRIV_REQUIRES`) for
`i2c_master`/`gpio`. The board (`paper_s3_panel.c`) brings up the shared I2C bus
and registers the touch provider.

## BSP — the display/touch seam (`bsp_*`)

`app/` calls `bsp_*` on both targets; the per-target split lives inside the BSP.
Drivers are struct-inheritance vtables: a provider embeds `bsp_display_t` /
`bsp_touch_t` as its first member and is registered with
`bsp_display_set_active()` / `bsp_touch_set_active()` by the board's `bsp_init()`.
`src/bsp_display.c` / `src/bsp_touch.c` implement the public API once by
dispatching through the active vtable.

### Display vtable (`inc_private/bsp_display.h`)

- **Always non-NULL:** `draw_bitmap` (blit a rectangle; its `bsp_rotation_t` arg
  un-rotates the source into the panel-coordinate rect, fused into the copy via the
  shared `bsp_blit_rotated` helper), `deinit`.
- **Optional (NULL when absent):** `get_framebuffers` + `flush` (host-framebuffer
  fast path — MIPI), `set_brightness` (backlight), and `set_epd_mode` + `refresh`
  (EPD only). The public `bsp_display_*` wrappers no-op when the op is NULL, so the
  API is uniform across panel types.

### Panel types & the EPD model

`bsp_display_type_t`: `SPI`, `MIPI_DSI`, `SPI_EPD`, `DIRECT_EPD`. EPD refresh
(`bsp_epd_mode_t` = `NONE`/`FAST`/`QUALITY`):

- `set_epd_mode(mode)` sets a **persistent** mode. `draw_bitmap` updates GRAM but
  only paints the panel when the mode is **not** `NONE`.
- `refresh(area, mode)` paints the latest GRAM with a one-shot mode (does not
  change the persistent mode).

(Consequence: a draw alone shows nothing on EPD — see [`docs/gotchas.md`](docs/gotchas.md).)

Below this seam the device driver (`driver/epd_ll.c`) is a **transaction-index
waveform engine**: one byte per pixel (`[7:4]=gray, [3:0]=tx id`), the diff-skip
done at draw time, up to 15 generations driving concurrently on the async task,
`FULL`/`CLEAR` aborting all in-flight. Its SoC-free core (`driver/epd_waveform.h`)
is host unit-tested via `esp-devkit/bsp/driver/test/run.sh`. Details + the single-buffer trade-offs:
[`docs/gotchas.md`](docs/gotchas.md). The simulator's `sdl_panel` EPD path replays
no waveform, so none of the engine is observable there — verify on hardware.

### Simulator backend (`bsp/simulator/sdl_panel.c`)

One SDL backend mimics all three panel families behind the same vtable, chosen by
`sdl_panel_config_t::type`:

- **MIPI:** host framebuffers; `flush(idx)` repoints what is presented (no copy).
- **SPI:** `draw_bitmap` blits straight to the on-glass buffer, shown immediately.
- **EPD:** `draw_bitmap` writes a GRAM buffer; the glass updates only on a
  non-NONE mode or `refresh`.

Presentation is deferred to the main thread (SDL/Cocoa is main-thread-only);
`sdl_panel_present()` does the actual render each loop iteration. Touch is a
mutex-guarded multi-touch snapshot (`bsp_touch_read` copies it on a background
task; the main thread samples the mouse in `sdl_panel_pump_input()`). See
[`docs/gotchas.md`](docs/gotchas.md) for the threading rules.

The window is **resizable with an aspect-preserving letterbox**: `present` fits the
(rotated) panel image into the drawable centered via `content_fit`, painting black
margins; `window_to_panel` inverts the same fit so touch stays aligned at any size.
The **r/l keys rotate the host view** (ESC quits): `present` rotates the texture
with `SDL_RenderCopyEx` and the window aspect is reset for 90/270; mouse coords
are un-rotated back in `window_to_panel`. This is a viewing convenience only — the
panel buffers and touch coordinate space are unchanged (independent of the app's
own `lv_display_set_rotation`). The initial rotation defaults to 0; set it at
configure time with the `SIM_DEFAULT_ROTATION` CMake cache var (0/90/180/270,
e.g. `-DSIM_DEFAULT_ROTATION=90`), which feeds the `SDL_PANEL_DEFAULT_ROTATION`
compile define. The harness **JPEG capture honors this rotation** so headless
verification images come out in the viewing orientation (deterministic, since
headless never runs the keys) — see [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).

`sdl_panel_create(config, &display, &touch)` returns both providers (touch
nullable) and **self-registers** its input + capture callbacks with the sim
harness, so the simulator entry needs no wiring for those.

## UI framework — LVGL port abstraction + UI utilities

`ui_framework/` is deliberately thin and panel-agnostic (no display, no touch, no
EPD) so esp-devkit stays reusable across boards. It ships two things:

**1. The LVGL port, abstracted by mirroring `esp_lvgl_port`'s API.** App code calls
`lvgl_port_init(&cfg)` identically on both targets:
- **device:** `lvgl.hpp` includes the real `<esp_lvgl_port.h>` (a managed dep
  declared in `ui_framework/idf_component.yml`), which owns the LVGL task + tick.
  LVGL config comes from sdkconfig (Kconfig `CONFIG_LV_*`).
- **simulator:** `lvgl.cpp` provides a tiny shim (`#ifndef ESP_PLATFORM`) with the
  same `lvgl_port_cfg_t` + `lvgl_port_init()` (= `lv_init()` + an SDL tick/delay)
  plus `lvgl_sim_loop(tick)` — the host present loop that pumps input, runs
  `lv_timer_handler()`, presents, and calls back `tick(is_idle)` per frame
  (`simulator/main/main.cpp` passes `sim_harness_frame`). Upstream LVGL is fetched
  with `FetchContent` (`release/v9.5`) and configured by the in-tree
  `ui_framework/sim/lv_conf.h` (override the dir with the `UI_FRAMEWORK_LV_CONF_DIR`
  CMake cache var). Only the two LVGL major.minor versions need agree.

**2. Reusable, panel-agnostic UI building blocks:**
- **`lvgl.hpp`** (lvgl++): std::function wrappers — `lv_async_call`,
  `lv_obj_add_event_fn`. To touch the UI from another task/thread, either lock with
  `lv_lock()`/`lv_unlock()` (portable — `LV_USE_OS` is FreeRTOS on device, PThread on
  the sim) or marshal onto the LVGL context with `lv_async_call` (runs the closure
  next tick).
- **`ScreenManager`/`Screen`**: a `shared_ptr`-based navigation stack
  (`load`/`push`/`pop`/`top`) that swaps the LVGL theme per screen and defers a
  leaving screen's destruction via `retire()` → `lv_async_call` (so freeing
  `root_` never deletes the active screen mid-event-dispatch). No panel knowledge.
- **`widgets/layout.hpp`** (pulled in by `lvgl.hpp`): flex-layout helpers —
  `lv_container_create` (style-stripped, optionally flex/colored), `lv_spacer_create`
  (grow-able), and `lv_{hor,ver}_separator_create`.

### The BSP↔LVGL binding + EPD policy live in the app

`app/NameCardKnot.cpp` creates the `lv_display`/`lv_indev`, owns the buffer +
pixel format, and supplies the flush callback — written only against `bsp_*` +
`lvgl` (both target-transparent), so the **same file compiles for simulator and
device**. The flush_cb blits each area with `bsp_display_draw_bitmap`, accumulates
the dirty rect, and on the last partial flush calls `bsp_display_refresh(dirty,
mode)`. The EPD refresh mode is the app's own simple policy, exposed via
`NameCardKnot.hpp`: `epd_set_default_refresh_mode()` (the standing mode) and
`epd_set_next_refresh_mode()` (overrides the next refresh). A new board re-tailors
this small glue; esp-devkit itself stays panel-free. Threading and EPD timing
caveats: [`docs/gotchas.md`](docs/gotchas.md).

### Screens & resources (app-side)

`app/screens/` holds the `Screen` subclasses (currently just `HomeScreen`); each
builds its tree in `build()` and is loaded via the `screen_manager`. `app_entry()`
loads the first screen with `lv_async_call` (onto the LVGL context).

`app/resources/` holds the UI assets, all `#include`-able C with no build step in
the repo: `converted/` is generated output (LVGL image converter for the `*_80px`
icons; lv_font_conv for `lucide_40` — see the `Opts:` header in each file for the
exact command), `lucide_font.h` maps Lucide glyph names to UTF-8 codepoints, and
the hand-written `resources.{c,h}` gathers them into the single `const struct
Resources R` that app code reads (`R.icon.*`, `R.font.*`). `Lucide_License.txt` is
the ISC license for the icon set. All of `app/` is GLOB'd into the build, so new
files are picked up after a cmake re-run (see `app/CMakeLists.txt`).
